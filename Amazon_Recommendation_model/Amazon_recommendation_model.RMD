This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

# Objective : Provide recommendation model based on Amazon fresh Dataset 
# DataSource: https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/machine-learning 

# STEP 1:

# Data Preprocessing
# install.packages('arules')
library(arules)

#Importing the dataset using read.csv
dataset = read.csv('C:/Users/Swapnil/Documents/Data Science Udemy/Machine Learning A-Z Template Folder/Part 5 - Association Rule Learning/Section 28 - Apriori/Section 28 - Apriori/R/Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv', header= FALSE)

## Since Apriori model accepts list, hence converting the dataset into transactions
dataset = read.transactions('C:/Users/Swapnil/Documents/Data Science Udemy/Machine Learning A-Z Template Folder/Part 5 - Association Rule Learning/Section 28 - Apriori/Section 28 - Apriori/R/Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv', sep = ',', rm.duplicates = TRUE)

# To have a better understanding and insight of dataset, let us see the summary
summary(dataset)

## Ploting the top 10 selling items within the store
itemFrequencyPlot(dataset, topN=10)

## Training Apriori

rules = apriori(data = dataset,parameter = list(support=0.005, confidence=0.2))
## The main aim is to set a appropriate support and confidence
# support is calculated as = (Min number of items purchased a day)*no.of days/total items sold
## Support changes according to the business problem, hence in this case I am going with those items which are purchased atleast 3 times a day
## Confidence (default = 0.8), this is a try and error method and for this model, 0.2 works the best

##Visulization of the output

inspect(sort(rules, by ='lift')[1:10])
## Selecting the top 10 recommendations with highest lif

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
